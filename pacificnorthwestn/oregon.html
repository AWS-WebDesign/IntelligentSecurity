          <td class="format1">Mount Hood</td>
        <td class="format2">Mount Hood is Oregon's most recognizable volcanic mountain and can easily be
        seen across both states. Between Mount Rainier and Mount Hood is the infamous
        Mount St. Helens. Further south, a volcano is missing in the Cascades. In
        Southern Oregon, Crater Lake is all that remains from the massive volcanic
        explosion of Mount Mazama 7700 years ago.</td>
        <td class="format3">The Pacific Northwest has many snow ski resorts close to urban areas
          including Mount Hood near Portland with skiing year round and the largest
          night ski area in America; Mount Bachelor ski area near Bend, Oregon</td>

        <td class="format1">Portland</td>
        <td class="format2">Portland is a bustling city full of character and surrounded by
          rivers, forests, farmland and hilly terrain. This, of course, attracts
          the type of people that appreciate the best of both worlds. Here you
          can enjoy a vibrant urban lifestyle and yet be minutes away from a
          paradise of outdoor activities. The city of Portland has earned many
          nicknames over the years including the City of Bridges, Beervana, and
          the City of Roses which gives some idea as to how much variety is on offer.
          Portland is also a somewhat unconventional city that prefers to start trends rather
          than follow them. The food truck craze, gourmet doughnuts and micro-craft breweries
          to name a few. There is even a distillery row in Portland now so watch out for a
          similar thing rising up in Seattle and Vancouver. Aside from the fun and quirky food
          trucks there are also plenty of amazing restaurants, cafes and brew pubs serving up
          every type of cuisine you can imagine. It’s nearly impossible to get a bad meal in this
          city!</td>

          <td class="format1">Willamette Valley</td>
          <td class="format2">The Willamette Valley is Oregon’s wine country. It starts just
            below Portland, stretches south to the city of Eugene and is some of
            the most fertile land in the northwest. But don’t imagine it to be
            nothing more than farmland. This area is considered to be the heartbeat
             of Oregon and is full of cute historic towns like McMinnville and
             Brownsville as well as the capitol city of Salem. But, of course,
            one of the best things about the Willamette Valley are all the great
             wineries. There are more than 500 wineries in this scenic valley and
             they produce many varietals including award winning Pinot Noir and
             Pinot Gris. When you get to the southernmost point of the Willamette
              Valley you will be in Eugene and if your taste buds are craving a
              change from wine you’re in luck because this town has a ton of great
              craft breweries. There is even a passport you can pick up for their
              Eugene Ale Trail!</td>
