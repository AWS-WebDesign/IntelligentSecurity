        <div class="center">Mount Hood</div></div>
    <div class="column middle">Mount Hood is Oregon's most recognizable volcanic mountain and can easily be
    seen across both states. Between Mount Rainier and Mount Hood is the infamous
    Mount St. Helens. Further south, a volcano is missing in the Cascades. In
    Southern Oregon, Crater Lake is all that remains from the massive volcanic
    explosion of Mount Mazama 7700 years ago.</div>
    <div class="column side">The Pacific Northwest has many snow ski resorts close to urban areas
      including Mount Hood near Portland with skiing year round and the largest
      night ski area in America; Mount Bachelor ski area near Bend, Oregon
    </div>

    <div class="column">  <div class="center">Portland</div></div>
    <div class="column middle">Portland is a bustling city full of character and surrounded by
      rivers, forests, farmland and hilly terrain. This, of course, attracts
      the type of people that appreciate the best of both worlds. Here you
      can enjoy a vibrant urban lifestyle and yet be minutes away from a
      paradise of outdoor activities. The city of Portland has earned many
      nicknames over the years including the City of Bridges, Beervana, and
      the City of Roses which gives some idea as to how much variety is on offer.
      Portland is also a somewhat unconventional city that prefers to start trends rather
      than follow them. </div>
<div class="column side">The food truck craze, gourmet doughnuts and micro-craft breweries
to name a few. There is even a distillery row in Portland now so watch out for a
similar thing rising up in Seattle and Vancouver. Aside from the fun and quirky food
trucks there are also plenty of amazing restaurants, cafes and brew pubs serving up
every type of cuisine you can imagine. It’s nearly impossible to get a bad meal in this
city!</div>

        <div class="column">  <div class="center">Willamette Valley</div></div>
        <div class="column middle">The valley is synonymous with the cultural and
          political heart of Oregon, and is home to approximately 70 percent of
          its population including the six largest cities in the state: Portland,
          Eugene, Salem, Gresham, Hillsboro and Beaverton. Eight of Oregon's top
          ten most populated cities, and 16 of its top 20 – are located in the
          Willamette Valley.The valley's numerous waterways, particularly the
          Willamette River, are vital to the economy of Oregon, as they continuously
          deposit highly fertile alluvial soils across its broad, flat plain.
          A massively productive agricultural area, the valley was widely publicized
          in the 1820s as a "promised land of flowing milk and honey". Throughout
          the 19th century it was the destination of choice for the oxen-drawn wagon
          trains of emigrants who made the perilous journey along the Oregon Trail.</div>
            <div class="column side">The Willamette Valley is Oregon’s wine country. It starts just
                below Portland, stretches south to the city of Eugene and is some of
                the most fertile land in the northwest. But don’t imagine it to be
                nothing more than farmland. This area is considered to be the heartbeat
                 of Oregon and is full of cute historic towns like McMinnville and
                 Brownsville as well as the capitol city of Salem. But, of course,
                one of the best things about the Willamette Valley are all the great
                 wineries. There are more than 500 wineries in this scenic valley and
                 they produce many varietals including award winning Pinot Noir and
                 Pinot Gris. When you get to the southernmost point of the Willamette
                  Valley you will be in Eugene and if your taste buds are craving a
                  change from wine you’re in luck because this town has a ton of great
                  craft breweries. There is even a passport you can pick up for their
                  Eugene Ale Trail! </div>
