Generally, there are <strong>three ways</strong> to process garbage
<ol>
  <li>landfill</li>
  Landfill is the most simple way, but in order to avoide the complex progress of
  processing the garbage, larger and more developed countries would sell the garbage
  to smaller and less developed countries to save money.
  <li>compost</li>
  Compost need a high requirement for the garbage, it need to be sorted and has
  to contain high organic content. However, the garbage can hardly meet the requirement
  which means not all the garbage can be processed in this way.
  <li>incineration</li>
  Relativly speaking, incineration is a better way to process the garbage, but the gas which is
  produced by incineration is toxic. The toxic gas is called Dioxin and it could cause cancer.
  <br>
