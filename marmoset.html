    <p>
Marmoset is the <em>smallest</em> primate. Most marmosets are about 20 centimetres (8 in)
long. Relative to other monkeys, they show some apparently <em>primitive features</em>:
they have claws rather than nails, and tactile hairs on their wrists. They lack
wisdom teeth, and their brain layout seems to be relatively primitive. Their
body temperature is unusually variable, changing by up to 4°C (7°F) in a day.
